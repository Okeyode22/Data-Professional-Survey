# Data-Professional-Survey

## Overview
This dashboard provides insights into the responses collected from a survey conducted by Alex Freeberg among individuals working in the field of data. All survey participants have roles within the data profession. 

#### Dataset
The dataset is in 'xlsx' file format. Before creating the dashboard in PowerBI, I conducted thorough data cleaning. This involved various transformations, including the addition of an 'Average Salary' column derived from the 'Current Yearly Salary' data. Additionally, I streamlined the dataset by eliminating unnecessary columns and simplifying responses in fields such as Role, Country of Origin, Favorite Programming Language, and more. This ensures a focused and concise representation of the survey data in the dashboard, facilitating a clearer understanding of key trends and patterns within the responses from individuals in the data profession.
